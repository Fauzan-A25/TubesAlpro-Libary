# Library Management System

This repository contains the code for a **Library Management System** developed as part of a Programming Algorithms course project. The system is designed to streamline the process of managing books, members, and borrowing activities within a library.

## 📚 Features

- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and search for books in the library's collection.
- **Member Management**: Manage library members, including adding, editing, and deleting member information.
- **Borrowing System**: Manage book borrowing and returning processes, including tracking due dates and fines.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for books and members using various criteria.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)**: The project is built using the Go programming language, known for its simplicity and efficiency.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: This project implements various data structures and algorithms to manage the library system effectively.

## 📖 Extended Description

The **Library Management System** is designed to help library staff efficiently manage their collections, members, and borrowing processes. It aims to provide a simple yet effective solution to common tasks within a library, such as:

- **Cataloging**: Organize books into different categories and genres, making it easy for members to find what they're looking for.
- **Member Registration**: Register and maintain records of library members, enabling tracking of borrowing history and member status.
- **Loan Management**: Manage the process of lending and returning books, ensuring that the inventory remains accurate and up-to-date.

This project is suitable for anyone looking to develop a deeper understanding of how to implement data structures and algorithms in a real-world application using Go.
